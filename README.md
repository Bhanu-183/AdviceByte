## Inspiration
There are many success stories around startup now a days.But there is no online platform for mentoriship of startups. Mentoring and guidance are very critical for early stage startups,as some startups fail in the initial state of developemt due to lack of support or proper knowledge. This project mainly designed to help upcoming startups by providing proper guidance in the field of their interest because we need a proper guidance in-order to achieve something.So we came up with this idea so that intrested mentors can voluntarily guide early start-ups and interested clients can ask help from them.

## What it does
"Adivce-Byte" is an online platform to help startups by mentoring them.The main idea of the project is to help the upcoming startups by providing qualified mentors for the topic which the start-up is based on or which the client requested.
As the new developers and startups need motivation and support this project helps to provide friendly and productive environment with experienced mentors.This online platform helps students who are enthusiastic and gives proper guidance 
and knowledge inorder to achieve their desired output.

## How we built it
We started designing with the landing page .In this page we included signup buttons through which Client Registrtion(For who came up with start up) and Login, Mentor Registration(For who shows intrest to mentor startups) and Login.
We gave an option to the client to choose their mentor based on which field they are intrested to work.Mentor names will be displayed based on the field of interest they mentioned while they are getting registered.And also when-ever mentor login to site client names will be displayed to mentors based on the field they are expertised in .For the backend we used MySQL.We hosted the website in infinity-free. And a common communication discord channel is created and made avaliable for the communication between client and mentor.

## Challenges we ran into
Familiraized more with git and it's features.
This project helped us to get back to our web developemt basics.
We learnt PhP for the back-end.
No one from our team hosted a dynamic website before and this is the first time we have done this
Team-work,it felt really great to divide the work among us and finish the work in time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Really  happy we have done something helpful for the coming youngsters with innovative ideas.
We are happy that we able to pull this off in such a short period of time.

## What we learned
->PhP
->Dynamic page hosting
->Team work

## What's next for AdviceByte
1)Make login page more strict such as including terms and conditions,password length etc.
2)So far we have made a discord channel for communication between mentor and client,we plan to include video communication such as zoom or google meet individually for each field of intrest through which the doubts can be clarified more effictively.
3)Include more fields of interest for the clients and mentors.
4)Add qualification,any certificate verification for the mentors to register
